         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>OR the better Order and Regulation to be had of the Market at <hi>Leaden-Hall</hi> and the <hi>Green-Yards</hi> there, with other Market-Grounds thereunto belonging, and of the Market at <hi>Woolchurch,</hi> and the Market of <hi>Honey-Lane</hi> or <hi>Milk-street,</hi> as also the Market near <hi>Newgate,</hi> and all other Common Markets already setled and appointed, or which hereafter shall be setled or appointed within the City of <hi>LONDON.</hi> Be it Enacted by the Right Honourable the Lord Maior and the Aldermen his Brethren, and the Commons in this Common Council assembled, and by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the same, That the former Act made by this Court the fifth day of <hi>September</hi> in the year of our Lord, One thousand six hundred seventy and two, concerning the Regulation of the Publick Markets of this City, and every Article and Clause therein be repealed, and the same are hereby repealed, and that the Rules, Orders and Directions hereafter prescribed be duly observed by all persons that are or may be concerned therein.</p>
            <p>And first, whereas by former Acts of Common Council, the Sale of Beef hath been restrained and appointed to be only in <hi>Leaden-Hall;</hi> which if now observed, would be very inconvenient to the Inhabitants of this City, in regard the late Butchery of the <hi>Stocks</hi> and St. <hi>Nicolas Shambles,</hi> which heretofore furnished with Beef and other FleshVictuals, those parts of the City, are now removed and otherwise disposed of, according to the Directions of a late Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Be it therefore Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That all and every Country Butcher and Butchers, Poulterer and Poulterers, Country Farmers, Victuallers, Laders or Kidders (except such Butchers and Poulterers as do or shall keep any Butchers or Poulterers Shop or Shops within the City of <hi>London</hi> or Liberties thereof, or within two Miles distance of the same) may from and after the Publication of this Act, use, occupy and employ such Standings, Stalls or Places in each respective Market as shall be provided for them, by and with the Consent and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the respective Collectors, only for the time being, of each respective Market, and there sell, utter and put to open shew or sale his; her or their Beef, Mutton, Veal, Lamb, Pork, Bacon and other Butchery or Poultry Wares, or other Country Provisions, upon such days of the week, and at such times, and in such manner as is herein after expressed and no otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi> Vpon <hi>Mundays, Wednesdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays</hi> weekly; from Six of the clock in the Morning until Eight of the clock in the Evening of the same days; and upon every <hi>Saturday</hi> from Six of the clock in the Morning until Ten of the clock at Night, for so long time only as he, she or they shall furnish the said Markets, Stalls, Standings and Places with wholsom Flesh, Victual and other Provisions, in his, her or their own right, and not as Servant or Servants, or otherwise, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of any others, any thing in any former Act of Common Council, or any other Law, Custom or Vsage of this City contained, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>Provided always, that it shall not be lawful for any Butcher or Poulterer, who doth inhabit or reside within the City of <hi>London</hi> or Liberties thereof, or within two miles distance of the same, to sell, utter, put or expose to open shew or sale, any Butchery or Poultry Wares, or other Provisions whatsoever, in any of the said respective Markets, upon any <hi>Friday</hi> throughout the year, upon pein that every such Butcher or Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer, for every time he, she or they shall sell, utter, put or expose to open shew or sale any Butchery or Poultry Wares in any of the said Markets upon any <hi>Friday</hi> in any week throughout the year, shall for every such Offence forfeit and pay the sum of Ten shillings.</p>
            <p>And to the end the respective hours aforesaid may be the better known and observed in the said Markets, Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the Market-Bell in each respective Market shall ring thrice every Market-day, (that is to say) the first Ringing of the Market-Bell to be at Six of the clock in the Morning, for all House-keepers and others who are no Retailers of Victual, to buy in their Provisions: And the second Ringing of the said Bell to be at Ten of the clock in the Forenoon of every such Market-day, for giving notice for all such as are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailers and Traders of this City, who buy to sell again, then to enter into any of the said Markets and not before, and there to buy and carry away such Provisions as they want or stand in need of: And the third and last Ringing of the said Bell, for raising the said Markets, to be at Eight of the Clock in the Evening of the same day, except on <hi>Saturdays,</hi> and then the last Ringing of the aforesaid Bell for raising the Market, to be at Ten of the clock of the same night. And if any Butcher or Butchers, Poulterer or Poulterers, Victuallers, Country-Farmer, Lader, Kidder, or other person whatsoever shall sell, put or expose to open shew or sale any manner of Butchery or Poultry Wares or other Provisions in the said Markets or any of them before the Ringing of the Bell at the aforesaid Hour of Six in the morning, such Offender or Offenders shall be proceeded against as Fore-stallers of the Market, as by the Law in that case is directed and appointed. And if any Butcher, Poulterer, Victualler, Country-Farmer, Lader, Kidder or other person or persons whatsoever, shall sell and put or expose to open shew or sale any Butchery, Poultry Wares, or other Provisions, in any of the said Markets, after the Ringing of the Bell at the said several hours in the Evening respectively, and shall not then depart from and quit the said respective Market, such Offender or Offenders shall for every such Offence forfeit and pay the sum of Twenty shillings. And if any Retailer or Trader in this City, who buy to sell again, do come into any of the said Markets to buy or cause to be bought, or carry away or cause to be carried away, any of the Provisions brought into the Market to be sold, to his, her or their respective Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or Shops, before the Ringing of the Bell at Ten of the clock in the Forenoon aforesaid, such Offender or Offenders shall for every such Offence forfeit and pay Forty shillings: The Markets being most principally intended for the Benefit and Advantage of House-keepers and others; who buy for their own use to be spent in their Families, and may provide for themselves in the morning at the best hand, and pay moderate Rates for their Provisions.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:205516:2"/>
            <p>And forasmuch as it hath been found by great experience, that the bringing in of Victuals and other Provisions into the Common Markets of this City in the Evening of the Market-days, under pretence of supplying the said Markets, hath been a great hinderance to the well ordering of the said Markets, and occasioned the undue vending of unwholsom Victuals, to the great prejudice of this City: Be it Enacted by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority aforesaid, That from and after the Publication of this Act, no Butcher, Poulterer, Country-Farmer, Lader, Kidder or other person or persons whatsoever, shall upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> in any week throughout the year, bring into any of the said Markets any manner of Flesh-meat or other Victuals or Provisions to be sold, after Three of the Clock in the Afternoon of the same day, upon pein that every such Offender or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders shall for every such Offence forfeit and pay the sum of Twenty shillings.</p>
            <p>Provided always, That all Country people resorting to the said Markets, not being Butchers nor Poulterers residing or inhabiting as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, may stand or sit, and vend their Herbs, Fruit, Butter, Eggs and other Provisions and Commodities in any of the said Markets, upon every working day in the week, so as the same persons that bring them first to Market do continue the selling thereof, and do observe the Hours for Ringing of the Market-Bell for keeping the said Hours accordingly, upon pein and penalty aforesaid.</p>
            <p>And further, That it shall and may be lawful for the Gardeners and other Country-people resorting to any of the said Markets early in the morning with Fruit, Herbs, Roots, Weeds, Plants and other such like Commodities, and there continuing for some short time and quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Market about Eight of the clock in the morning, to open, put and expose to open shew or sale such their respective Commodities at their first coming, and beore the Ringing of the Market-Bell, any thing in this Act contained, or any former Law, Custom or Vsage of this City to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as all dead Flesh-meat and other Victuals and Provisions of all sorts, Fruit, Herbs, Fish, Meal and Bread ought to be sold in open and Common Markets allowed and appointed, and not under p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">
